## Foreign-trait allowlist as configuration

`is_foreign_trait()` (`src/collector.rs`) checks a hardcoded ~40-name
`KNOWN_FOREIGN_TRAITS` list plus a `std`/`core`/`alloc` first-segment check
to decide whether a trait impl counts as a local architectural seam. Any
third-party framework trait not on that list — `tokio::io::AsyncRead`,
`axum::extract::FromRequest`, and similar — gets misclassified as local,
inflating `trait_ratio` for codebases built on such frameworks. Already
self-disclosed in the README's Limitations section as an inherent
AST-only, no-type-resolution constraint — not fixable in general, but a
per-project allowlist extension would narrow it for the common case.

Not started. Likely shape: an optional `--foreign-traits <file>` flag or a
`.grip.toml` listing additional names, merged with `KNOWN_FOREIGN_TRAITS`
at runtime.
