## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- Per-function tracking: `FunctionInfo` struct with `name`, `file`, `is_pure`, `is_public`
- `Collector::collect` returns `(ItemCounts, Vec<FunctionInfo>)` — per-function data alongside aggregates
- `GripReport.functions` field — all functions with file paths in JSON output
- `type CollectedFiles` alias for cleaner return types
- Private functions visible in JSON output (`is_public` field on each function entry)

### Changed
- Grip score simplified to `grip = pure_ratio × 100` (no public_ratio weighting)

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- `FunctionInfo` first version with per-function tracking
- Grip score formula refined

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- `Walk`, `Scorer`, `Reporter` traits in `src/traits/` — protocol dependency seams
- `FsWalk`, `DefaultScorer`, `StdoutReporter` concrete implementations behind traits
- `App::with_deps()` constructor for dependency injection (testing, alternate impls)
- Incremental file cache in `.grip_cache/cache.json` — re-parses only changed files
- `Cache` struct with mtime+size-based cache keys
- `cache_tests.rs` — hit and miss coverage

### Changed
- `visit_item` decomposed: 50-line match → 7-line dispatcher dispatching to `visit_fn`,
  `visit_struct`, `visit_trait`, `visit_enum`, `visit_mod`
- `App::run` decomposed: `collect_files`, `compute_report`, `handle_output` extracted
- `ItemCounts` derives `Serialize`, `Deserialize` for cache serialization

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- Phase 0: public surface + pure function ratio analysis
- CLI: `cargo grip [PATH]`, `--json`, `--threshold N`
- `#[cfg(test)]` and `#[cfg_attr(..., test)]` detection — test code excluded from analysis
- Purity heuristic: no `&mut` params, non-`()` return, no `unsafe` blocks
- JSON output with `--json` flag
- 46 integration tests across 13 source files, AAA-compliant
- `scripts/run_stage_1.ps1` and `scripts/run_stage_2.ps1` CI gates
- README with formula, score table, roadmap, and limitations
- ROADMAP with 4-phase plan

### Changed
- Struct consolidation: `Scorer`, `Reporter`, `App` as structs with methods
- `UnsafeFinder` extracted to own file
- Shortened qualifying paths (`args::Args` → `Args`, etc.)
- Crate renamed from `grip` to `cargo-grip`

### Fixed
- `cfg_attr` false positive — now checks `test` in token payload
- AAA blank-line separation across all tests

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- Initial publish on crates.io as `cargo-grip`
- Hello-world binary with cargo subcommand support
- `Cargo.toml` metadata, MIT license, README placeholder
